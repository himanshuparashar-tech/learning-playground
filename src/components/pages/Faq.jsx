        question: '👉 What is React.js, and why do we use it?',
        answer: (
            <>
                <strong>Define: </strong>React JS is a Javascript Library used for building User Interface (UI), especially for single page applications (SPA).
                <br /><br />
                It allows developers to create reusable UI components, manage state efficiently and update only the parts of UI that change(thanks to Virtual DOM)
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Logic: </strong> Without React, updating the UI manually everytime data changes is complex. React makes it easy by automatically updating the components when data(state) changes.
            </>

    {
        question: '👉 What is a Component in React?',
        answer: (
            <>
                <strong>Define: </strong>A component is a reusable piece of UI that you can think of as a small building block
                It can be Function Component or the Class Component
                <br /><br />
                <strong>example: </strong>
                <code>
                    {
                        `function Welcome() {
                            return <h1>Hello</h1>;
                        }`
                    }
                </code>
                <br /><br />
                <strong>logic: </strong> Components make code reusable and easier to maintain. You can make multiple components and combine them like LEGO blocks to build complex UIs
            </>
        )
    },
    {
        question: '👉 What is JSX and why is it used in React?',
        answer: (
            <>
                <strong>Define: </strong> JSX(Javascript XML) lets you write the HTML inside Javascript.
                It is not required to use React but it makes the code more readable & easier to write.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Example: </strong>
                <code>
                    {
                        `const element = <h2>Welcome to React!</h2>`
                    }
                </code>
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Logic: </strong> JSX is a template language but with full power of Javascript.
                Behind the scenes, JSX is converted into the Javascript using a tool like BABEL.

                            `🔍 Step-by-Step Difference Explanation
                        1. React 18 introduced a new rendering system — “Concurrent Mode”

                        React 18 brought a new internal engine (called Concurrent Rendering) that makes the UI smoother and faster by:

                        Letting React pause, resume, and even cancel renders.

                        Preparing updates in the background.

                        Avoiding UI freezes during heavy operations.

                        🧩 To enable this, React introduced a new API:
                        createRoot from 'react-dom/client'

                        ✅ This new API replaces the old ReactDOM.render() or old style ReactDOM.createRoot() that didn’t fully support concurrency.

                        2. The StrictMode wrapper

                        StrictMode is not required, but highly recommended.

                        It helps:

                        Detect side effects.

                        Warn about deprecated APIs.

                        Double-invokes some functions in dev mode to help you write safe code (but only in dev, not in production).

                        Think of it like a safety helmet for your React app 🪖

                    <code>
                        {`

                        Here are some of the major additions and changes:

                        ✅ New “Actions” API

                        React 19 introduces a concept called Actions — essentially async functions that describe work (e.g., form submission, data updates) and integrate with React’s state/transition system.
                        React
                        +1

                        This reduces boilerplate: you don’t have to manually handle “pending”, “error”, “success”, etc, in many cases.
                        React
                        +1

                        ✅ New hooks like useActionState, useOptimistic

                        These hooks help you manage the state of these Actions — whether they’re pending, error, completed — and support optimistic updates (showing UI updates before server confirms) more easily.
                        React
                        +1

                        ✅ Improved Server Components & SSR/hydration

                        React 19 enhances support for server-side rendering (SSR), better hydration of components, and more seamless integration of client + server logic.
                        GeeksforGeeks
                        +1

                        For example, features like “partial pre-rendering” in 19.2 allow parts of the app to be pre-rendered and resumed later.
                        React

                        ✅ Other improvements

                        Better handling of custom elements/web components.
                        DEV Community
                        +1

                        Enhanced error messages and debugging tools.
                        eLuminous Technologies

                        More control over metadata (title/meta tags) and resources like scripts/stylesheets.

                        🍳 Cooking Analogy

                        Imagine you’re running a restaurant kitchen:

                        React 18 is like having a smart stove that can cook many dishes at once (concurrent rendering, automatic batching).

                        React 19 upgrades the kitchen further:

                        You now have a smart order system (Actions) — when an order comes in, it tracks “preparing”, “cooking”, “served” automatically.

                        You have efficient backup chefs (optimistic updates) who start prepping while the main dish is cooking.

                        The delivery system (SSR/hydration) is improved — some dishes come partially prepared from the back-kitchen and finish in front of the customer.

                        And you have better kitchen tools & diagnostics (error messages, debug tools) so you can spot mistakes instantly.

                        So, upgrading from React 18 to React 19 is like upgrading your kitchen gear and workflow — you can cook faster, handle more orders simultaneously, reduce delays, and handle mistakes more gracefully.
